## The Benefits and Virtues of Reading and Reciting Surah Al Baqarah
 
Surah Al Baqarah is not only a long and comprehensive chapter of the Quran, but also a very powerful and beneficial one. According to many authentic hadiths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad), reading and reciting Surah Al Baqarah has many rewards and blessings in this life and the hereafter. Here are some of them:

- Surah Al Baqarah is a source of guidance and protection from evil. Allah says in verse 2: "This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah." And in verse 255 (also known as Ayatul Kursi), He says: "Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great."
- Surah Al Baqarah is a means of attaining Allah's mercy and forgiveness. The Prophet Muhammad said: "Recite Surat Al-Baqara in your houses, for the devil does not enter a house in which Surat Al-Baqara is recited." (Sahih Muslim) He also 0f148eb4a0
